# personal-webpage
This is a copy of a django web app prepared to be deployed to heroku plataform: adriex.herokuapp.com

WARNING:
  This is a copy of an early page stage, so it might not look as it does now (and all the code is very messy), besides the only reason to be here is because of the project configuration for heroku.
  Heroku demands some previous configuration before upload to it. At the moment of the creation of this repository, the heroku documentation about how to configurate Django projects wasnÂ´t working (for me, at least) so I managed to make it work and here it is.
